## The Strummi

The _Strummi_ is a guitar-based Accessible Digital Musical Instrument _(ADMI)_ designed to make guitar playing more physically accessible while preserving the tactile and acoustic response of real guitar strings.
It was developed as part of my PhD research at Queen Mary University of London, with my co-researcher Robert Jack.
It runs on c++ on the [Bela](https://bela.io/) environment.

The _Strummi_ was influenced by instruments such as the [Kalichord](https://blog.bela.io/2017/05/15/kalichord/) and [BladeAxe](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~rmichon/bladeaxe/).
It uses the real acoustic signal from dampened guitar strings to excite a physical model of a vibrating string.
The resulting sound is quite realistic and allows for a lot of the subtleties of string plucking gestures to be preserved.
The benefit of doing it this way rather than using full-length acoustic guitar strings is that the tuning is done digitally, so the strings can be very short.
This gives us a lot of flexibility in terms of the shape and size of the instrument, and the method for changing chords and notes.

The Strummi has been used in a number of research projects as well as community music sessions and live performances.
We are hoping to continue developing the Strummi and hope to work with disabled musicians to develop the design and see it on stage.
