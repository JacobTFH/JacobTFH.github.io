## The Strummi

The _Strummi_ is a guitar-based Accessible Digital Musical Instrument _(ADMI)_ designed to make guitar playing more physically accessible while preserving the tactile and acoustic response of real guitar strings.
It was developed as part of my PhD research at Queen Mary University of London, with my co-researcher Robert Jack.
It runs on c++ on the [Bela](https://bela.io/) environment.

The _Strummi_ was influenced by instruments such as the [Kalichord](https://blog.bela.io/2017/05/15/kalichord/) and [BladeAxe](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~rmichon/bladeaxe/).
It uses the real acoustic signal from dampened guitar strings to excite a physical model of a vibrating string.
The resulting sound is quite realistic and allows for a lot of the subtleties of string plucking gestures to be preserved.
The benefit of doing it this way rather than using full-length acoustic guitar strings is that the tuning is done digitally, so the strings can be very short.
This gives us a lot of flexibility in terms of the shape and size of the instrument, and the method for changing chords and notes.

It has been used in a number of research projects as well as community music sessions and live performances.
We are hoping to continue developing the Strummi and hope to work with disabled musicians to develop the design and see it on stage.

## RePlay: Musical instrument for stroke rehabilitation

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/403623242">REPLAY -  A new instrument for upper limb rehabilitation</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/cwplus">CW+</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

The _RePlay_ study is an ongoing collaborative project between Queen Mary University of London and CWPlus at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital.
Working with Robert Jack and Andrew McPherson at the [Augmented Instruments Lab](http://instrumentslab.org/) and Andrew Hall from [CWPlus](https://www.cwplus.org.uk/), we developed an instrument designed to support stroke rehabilitation exercises for upper limb impairments.
Drawing on the expertise of the occupational therapists at the Nell Gwynne stroke ward, we designed an instrument based on a harp which would encourage patients to practice arm extension exercises for broad 'strums' and finer motor skills for individual 'plucks'.
The instrument uses a large number of touch-sensitive brass rods, each one filed and polished to varying sizes.
The layout of the rods enables patients to strum chords and arpeggios by focusing on the larger rods, and pluck melodies from other degrees of the scale on the smaller rods embedded in between.
Our goal was to ensure that the instrument didn't have the appearance of a piece of medical equipment, instead aiming for an 'heirloom' quality, using materials such as wood and brass, and obscuring the embedded digital technology inside.

The project has unfortunately been postponed since March 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but we are looking forward to collecting more data from the patients and staff when it is safe to do so.
